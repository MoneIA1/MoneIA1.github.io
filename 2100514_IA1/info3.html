				Moral Development refers to the changes in moral beliefs as a person grows<br/>
				older and gains maturity. A person`s moral development is strongly affected by factors <br>
				such as:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Family</b></li>
						<li><b>Peers</b></li>
						<li><b>Culture</b></li>
					</ul>
				Interpersonal factors also impact moral development such as <b>cognitive changes</b> and <b>emotions</b>		
				When i was younger I always try to do things which are pleasing in the eyes of my parents and not for myself.<br/>  
				Moral development is a concern for every parent. Teaching a child to distinguish right from wrong and to <br/>
				behave accordingly is a goal of parenting. Moral development is a complex issue that since the beginning of human <br/> 
				civilization has been a topic of discussion among some of the world's most distinguished psychologists.
		    </p>
			<p>
				Religious development often goes hand in hand with moral development. Children's concepts of divinity, right and wrong, and<br/>
				who is ultimately responsible for the world. These children are shaped by their family and by the religious social group to which <br/>
				each child belongs. Their concepts also mirror cognitive moral developmental stages.

            <p><strong>In the book 'Twelve pillars' by <i>Jim Rohn</i></strong></p>
            <p>The book blends together the fundamental principles and teachings of Jim Rohn</p>
            <p>I discovered three lessons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Achieving my goals</b></li>
                <p>Goal setting is deciding where i want to go and then designing a plan to get there. I learnt that setting a goal will stretch me </br> 
                and make me do things differently to get to the future that i want, and also not to wait on people to set goals for me.</p>
                <li><b>Proper use of time</b></li>
                <p>Everyday has many oppurtunities, but only one best oppurtunity. The best oppurtunity is the one that alines with my goals. I learned that i can </br>
                suffer from the pain of decipline or the pain of regret and the difference is that dicipline weighs ounces and regret weighs tons.</p>
                <li><b>surrounding my self with the best people</b></li>
                <p>I learned that i should never join an easy crowd; if i want to grow. I have to go where the expectations are high.</br>
                I should look for relationships with people that will push me, challenge me, and encourage me to become better.</p>
            </ul>
