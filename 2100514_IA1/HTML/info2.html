					<p>I am a dedicated hard working respectable young man born on the 13th of March 2002.<br/>
					I am from the parish of Manchester I am the fifth child of my parents Donna Hutchinson and Donald Levy<br/>
					I enjoy hobbies such as researching, watching movies,listing to music,playing football and socializing with my family & friends.<br/>
					If I should name something I like and dislike I would say; I like to be surrounded by people that push me to do better, however,<br/>
					I dislike persons that tells lies.</p>
					<p>  My likes and dislikes contribute to my character as it allows me to be mindful of how I treat others as how I would like to be treated. <br/>
					Some of my character traits includes the fact that I am passionate, persistent, disciplined, optimistic and willing.<br/>
					I have morals and values which I use to guide my day to day living. One of the philosophies that guide<br/> 
					my life is “If you have no confidence in self, you are twice defeated in the race of life” by Marcus Garvey. Marcus Garvey tried to promote unity among the <br/>
					people and encouraged us to be concerned with ourselves first. This quote means a lot to me as it motivates me to have faith in my abilities and to be confident in everything I do.
